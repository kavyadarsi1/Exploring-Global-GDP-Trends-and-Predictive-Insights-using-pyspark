## Exploring Global GDP Trends and Predictive Insights

### Overview
This project delves into an in-depth analysis of global GDP trends by examining various economic and demographic indicators, including health and education expenditures, industrial activities, and trade balances. Utilizing a rich dataset from the World Bank, our analysis provides valuable insights into the economic conditions and developmental trajectories of nations worldwide.


### Objectives

The project aims to:

- Predict a country's GDP based on health expenditures, education expenditures, industrial activities, and other factors.
- Forecast future inflation rates by analyzing historical data.
- Classify countries into groups with similar economic characteristics and performances.
- Assess and predict trade balances by analyzing historical exports, imports, and net trade data.
- Explore the impact of health and education expenditures on a country's economic well-being.

### Methodologies and Technologies Used

- Data Preprocessing: Mean imputation based on continental regions to handle missing values, ensuring contextually relevant data imputation.
- Analysis Techniques: Social, Economy, and Trade Indicator Analysis using scatter plots and time series data to explore trends.
- Clustering: K-means clustering to segment nations based on GDP and Net Trade.
- Predictive Modeling: Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, PCA with Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, AutoRegressor, and Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR) for forecasting GDP and analyzing trade balances.
- Software and Libraries: Python, Spark for big data processing, scikit-learn for machine learning models, and Matplotlib for data visualization.

### Key Findings
- A positive correlation between GDP growth and expenditures in health, education, industry, and R&D sectors.
- Trade balance analysis revealed countries like China, Germany, and Russia with trade surpluses, whereas the United States, India, and the United Kingdom showed trade deficits.
- Clustering analysis helped identify groups of countries with similar economic characteristics.
- The linear regression model showed an R² value of 0.991, indicating a strong fit to the data, while the decision tree regression model's performance was lower, with an R² value of 0.611.
- The Gradient Boosting Regressor model outperformed the AutoRegressor in forecasting India's GDP, demonstrating a tight correlation between actual and predicted GDP with an R² value of 0.967.

### Challenges and Solutions
- Handling missing values and ensuring accurate model predictions was addressed through mean imputation and careful feature selection.
- Balancing model complexity to avoid overfitting involved choosing appropriate machine learning algorithms and tuning model parameters.
- The diversity in economic structures among countries required nuanced analysis and model adaptation to capture unique characteristics accurately.

### Conclusion
Our comprehensive analysis highlights the diverse economic landscapes across nations and underscores the importance of tailored economic policies. The predictive insights from this project can aid policymakers and researchers in strategizing for future growth and development. The findings reveal the critical role of health and education expenditures in economic well-being and the significance of trade balances in shaping a country's economic resilience.
